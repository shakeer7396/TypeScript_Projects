1. What is Testing ?
A. Software Testing is the process of finding the errors of the software product before it is launched.
 Validate functioning and features of software

2. Types of testing 
A. Testing --> Manual testing  , Automation Testing

3. Testing By developers
A. Unit Testing,    --> Testing individual units of components
 Integration Testing,--> Testing between two units or components
  E to E Testing      --> Test Start to End complete project

4. React Testing Tools
A. a) Jest Framework     b) React Testing Library

5. Setup
A. npx create-react-app blog-app  -> Then enter cd blog-app ->then npm start 
    -> open terminal then enter npm run test

6. Start with basic javaScript file Testing Logic
---------------------------------------------------------------
A. Create sum.js file and do code there && create sum.test.js for testing the code with expected output
    Go to google enter jest then https://jestjs.io/ inside this page go to API and go below methods click this or see -> test(name, fn, timeout)  //It is a sintax for test function

    sum.js
    export default function sum(a,b){
    return a+b;
}
sum.test.js
import sum from "./sum";

//Test function takes three parameters 1-message, 2-call back func (write inside tesing output), 3-setTimeout for setting time for how much time after output will show. Add after the func },there);

test("testing for sum function-1",()=>{
expect(sum(10,20)).toBe(20)  //toBe means muje itna output chahiye batana hai
});

// Add more test functions this type also declare the variables there
test("testing for sum function-2",()=>{
    let a =10;
    let b =20;
    let output= 30;
    expect(sum(a,b)).toBe(output)  //toBe means muje itna output chahiye batana hai
    });

-> What need to import
-> How to render the component
-> How tests working with RTL
-> How test finding UI elements
